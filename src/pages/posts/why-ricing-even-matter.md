Ricing is the art of making your linux desktop beautiful emphasize the
aesthetically and the personal of the daily driver.

Stumble into ricing recently put me into question whether all of this is a huge
time waster ricing itself is a time consuming task after all. You learn the
tools, you hand picked the tool, you the configure the tool to match your value
of beauty describing your mean of aesthetics and putting the you inside your
desktop.

Well from the look of it i can't really see how ricing will lead you to the
productivity drag. In the form of itself or from what I view it's the process of
ricing that build character, identity and pride. This is the badge you wear, the
ornament decoration you dedicated to show the world your own view.

Human have always have this sense of the self and trace back history across
cultures. Weapon like sword and shield have been found to have decoration,
symmetry and ornamentation that goes beyond the sense of pure function. And
modern world ain't much different either people decorate their house for part of
their identity. Same goes for working setup and fashion.

Another plus point I find point to the aesthetic-usability effect a
physiological where the user view aesthetic pleasing product as more usable and
effective even though functionality wise is the same

Therefore like the smith back in the day enhancing their work with their idea of
the wielders or putting name in katana. The art of ricing is in no way a drag in
productivity while time consuming indeed. It's a force multiplier to the workers
a pleasant tools mean more pleasant hours out of it. Reducing fatigue and burn
out. It's the respect and value you put in using great tool to create great
works.

This still beg the question of what is the mean of productivity ? Next post I

## Updated 3-9 Appreciate The Rice

I'm getting to the point of being pretty happy with the cooking I did with
hyprland. I end up rewrote some of the previous thing I used as well, in a way
that I actually like it not using any pre-made out of the box. Things like
`tmux` and `neovim` are now customize accordingly. This is two essential work
combo across system and having spending time making it your own brought control
over my tools box.

Things stop getting annoying maintaining anymore due to the fact that I actually
understand how things work, it's doesn't feel like an up hill battle. May be
it's true that competent built confident and anxiety, depression, burn out stray
from the lack of it. This is where learn helplessness start.

It's not like things gonna magically stop breaking. No it's still went through
constant update people are changing stuff and break things all the time ðŸ˜©.
Differently from the past however I can hack myself around it now opt out of
update or just took sometimes to update the change by searching through GitHub
issue.

Arch and Hyprland and ricing retaught me the art of reading. LLM at the moment
still lies to you all the times by actually assets the issues and iterate
through it this should be how we gain benefit from the modern work. Skill still
matter at all times.

Their still a couple things left on the table that I would like to push through
to complete the set. An application launcher with clipboard support, the actual
install script that can set up this new environment from start not having KDE
install on the side.
